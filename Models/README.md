Models
===========

All models included here were downloaded from the [Trimble 3D Warehouse] (http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/). 
All models from the 3D Warehouse were obtained royalty-free as per the [3D Warehouse Terms of Service] (http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/preview_tos.html).

Original Sketchup models (.skp files) were coverted to Wavefront models (.obj/.mtl files) using Sketchup/Blennder to be rendered in the application.
